Q.js is a micro JavaScript library compiled from the most useful parts of [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [Underscore](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore), [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash), and [assorted micro libraries](http://microjs.com/).

# Features

1. Sugars for **DOM selection and manipulation**, **collection and object functions**, **event binding**, and **HTTP POST/GET**.
2. [Vanilla JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/); no dependencies.
3. Contract-based/non-defensive; you must know what you're doing.
4. Function-style, as opposed to method chaining *a la* jQuery.
5. Works in IE9+ and all modern browsers.
